## Warmup Questions

1. By considering $n^2 - (n-1)^2$ express $n^2$ as a sum of $n$ terms .
1. Integrate $x^2$ from first principles. Drawing a diagram and the fact that $1+4+\cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ may be useful.
1. Evaluate $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{cos(x)}{x}$.

## CSAT Question

Evaluate $\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left(\frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n}\right)$. Hint: Graph sketching may help.


## Approach 1

### Hints
1. What does the graph of $\frac{1}{x}$ look like?
1. Maybe put the terms of the sum on your graph?
1. Can you represent each term as a shape with an area equal to the terms value?
1. Can you come up with 2 continuous functions as upper and lower bounds for the terms of the sum? (Think of a way to link to the rectangles you drew in previous hint.)
1. For n=5, the graph should look like this: ![](https://i.imgur.com/cPfwiI9.png)
What are the areas underneath the two functions, and how do they relate to the sum? 
1. Try using the squeeze theorem.

### Solution

Each number $\frac{1}{k}$ is equal to the area of the rectangle extending to the right of the number, having height $\frac{1}{k}$ and width 1. By sketching, notice there are two obvious continuous functions bounding these rectangles, one above, i.e. $\frac{1}{x-1}$, and one below, i.e. $\frac{1}{x}$, whose integrals will also bound the initial sum under the limit. 
  
Concretely,
  
  $$
  \int_{n+1}^{2n+1} \frac{dx}{x} < \sum_{k=n+1}^{2n}\frac{1}{k} < \int_{n+1}^{2n+1}\frac{dx}{x-1}.
  $$
  At $n\rightarrow\infty$, both integrals become $\ln2$.

## Approach 2

### Hints
1. Write expression in summation notation. Furthermore, could you restrict the starting index of both summations to $k=1$?
2. You should get $f(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{2n}\frac{1}{k} -\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k}$. How can you rewrite this sum using parity?
3. What is the Taylor expansion of ln(x+1)?

### Solution

Write $f(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{2n}\frac{1}{k} -\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k}$ and consider the terms of these two sums. By pairing the even terms of the first sum with the terms of the second sum, each pair gives $\frac{1}{2k}-\frac{1}{k}=-\frac{1}{2k}$. We are left with the odd terms and the negative even terms, which give:
$f(n)=1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n-1}-\frac{1}{2n}.$

This is the alternating harmonic series, which is known to converge to $\ln2$ when $n\to\infty$. Alternatively, one can also expand (Taylor) the function $\ln(1+x)$ and take $x=1.$

## Approach 3
### Hints
1. How does the expression change when n changes ?
2. If we write $f(n) = \frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n}$. What is $f(n)-f(n-1)$?
3. How can you use the previous hint to express $f(n)$ as a sum of $2n$ terms?
4. Does the Taylor expansion of $ln(1+x)$ look familiar?
 
### solution
Let $f(n) = \frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n}$. We aim to express f(n) as a different sum. To achive this, we use the fact that $f(n) = f(1) + \left( f(2) - f(1) \right) + \cdots + \left(f(n)-f(n-1)\right)$. Notice that all terms except $f(n)$ get canceled in this expression. Now consider  $$f(k)-f(k-1) = \frac{1}{2k-1}+\frac{1}{2k} - \frac{1}{k} = \frac{1}{2k-1}-\frac{1}{2k}.$$ Now we can put this result into our formula for $f(n)$ and hence obtain $$f(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n}  \frac{1}{2k-1}-\frac{1}{2k} = 1 -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n}.$$ Now we can notice that these are the first $2n$ terms of the Taylor expansion of $\ln2$. Hence, $\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} f(n) = \ln2.$
