<p>Given a sequence of zeros and ones of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(L_n\)</span> be the number of sequences that have no adjacent zeros. Give a recursive formula for <span class="math inline">\(L_n\)</span>.</p>

<li>Try to list all the correct sequences for n=1,2,3.</li>
<li>Focus on the first element of a sequence. What cases do you need to consider to reduce a problem to a smaller <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>?</li>
<li>If there is a 1 in the first position of a sequence, how many ways (in terms of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>) are there to finish the sequence?</li>
<li>There are <span class="math inline">\(L_{n-1}\)</span> ways to finish a sequence that begins with a 1. What about a sequence that starts with a 0?</li>
<li>If the sequence begins with 0 what are possible values on the second element and how many ways are there to finish this sequence? ## Solution One way to find a recursive formula for <span class="math inline">\(L_n\)</span> is to reduce the problem of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to a problem of smaller size. To do this we will consider all possibilities for the first element of a sequence. It can be either <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If the word begins with a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> it can be followed by any word of length <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> with no adjacent 0s. There are <span class="math inline">\(L_{n-1}\)</span> such words.</li>
<li>If the word begins with a 0 it has to be followed by a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and then any word of length <span class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span> with no adjacent 0s. There are <span class="math inline">\(L_{n-2}\)</span> such words.</li>
</ul>
<p>These 2 cases are mutually exclusive so the total number of such words is <span class="math inline">\(L_n=L_{n-1}+L_{n-2}\)</span> which is the same as the Fibonacci recurrence. Note that for <span class="math inline">\(n=2\)</span> there are 3 such words, for <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span> there are 5 such words etc., so <span class="math inline">\(L_n=F_{n+2}\)</span>.</p>
