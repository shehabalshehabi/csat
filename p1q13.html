<h2 id="sol</div></div>ution">Solution</h2>
<p>Regardless of the path taken, you must travel <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> steps right and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> steps down. Of these consecutive <span class="math inline">\(m+n\)</span> steps, we consider the number of different ways we may choose <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to be rightward steps. This is <span class="math inline">\(\binom{m+n}{m}\)</span>. For each of these combinations, the remaining <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> steps down are uniquely determined i.e.Â there is only 1 combination since <span class="math inline">\(\binom{m+n-m}{n} = \binom{n}{n} = 1\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\binom{m+n}{m}\)</span> is our final answer.</p>
<p>Similarly, we may first find the combinations of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> downward steps and fix rightward steps to obtain <span class="math inline">\(\binom{m+n}{n}\)</span> as our answer.</p>
<p>Another way to look at this is to consider the permutations of <span class="math inline">\(m+n\)</span> steps, where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> rightward steps and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> downward steps are both indistinguishable types of steps. We find the number of permutations for <span class="math inline">\(m+n\)</span> things, and remove (by dividing by) the number of permutations specifically for just the rightwards and downward steps. This gives us the answer <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(m+n)!}{m! \cdot n!}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, any of the following expressions are equivalent and correct:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\binom{m+n}{m} \equiv \binom{m+n}{n} \equiv \frac{(m+n)!}{m! \cdot n!}\]</span></p>
