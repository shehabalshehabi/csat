## CSAT Question
What is the units digit of the number $\sum_{n=1}^{1337}(n!)^4$

## Hints
1. Find $n!$ up to $n=7$.
1. Consider the factors of $(n!)^4$ up to $n=7$. What can you say about numbers for $n \geq  5$
1. All numbers with $n \geq 5$ have $10$ as a factor. What about the units digits for $n < 5$?
1. It's sufficient to take only the units digit when multiplying or raising the number to any power.

## Solution
All factorials greater that $5!$ have both the factors $5$ and $2$. Since $5 \cdot 2=10$, $10$ is a factor. Hence, the numberâ€™s unit digit must be a $0$. This means that we only need to worry about the numbers corresponding to $n \in \{1,2,3,4\}$. It's sufficient to take only the units digit when multiplying or raising to any power. 

We have: 
- $1^4\rightarrow1$
- $(2!)^4=2^4\rightarrow6$
- $(3!)^4=6^4\rightarrow6$
- $(4!)^4=24^4\rightarrow4^4\rightarrow6$ 

The units digit for the sum is therefore $1+6+6+6\rightarrow9$.
