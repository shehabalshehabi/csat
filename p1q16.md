## CSAT Question

Dividing $x$ by a small annual $r$-percent cumulative interest rate approximates the number of
years needed to double your investment with a bank. Find $x$. 
Hint: The Taylor expansion of $\ln(1+x)=x-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}-\cdots$.


### Hints
1. For $r$-percent cumulative interest, how much money will you have after $n$ years?
2. Considering the case where the amount of money doubles, what is the number of years, $n$, in terms of the interest rate $r$.
3. Can you use the fact that $r$ is small and the Taylor series for $ln(1+x)$ to simplify your expression?


### Solution

The question asks us to find $x$, which when divided by $r$ approximates the number of years needed to double the investment. This translates to $\frac{x}{r} = n.$ Let the initial investment amount be $a_0$, and the amount left in the bank after $n$ years be $a_n$. Each year, the amount increases by $r$ percent, which gives us the recurrence $a_{n+1} = a_n(1+\frac{r}{100}).$ This is a standard geometric series. Therefore, the closed form solution is $a_n = a_0 (1+\frac{r}{100})^n.$

We wish to find a particular $n$ such that $a_n = 2a_0.$ We now substitute this into the closed form solution above to obtain $2 = (1+\frac{r}{100})^n,$ and apply natural log to get $n = \frac{\ln 2}{\ln(1+\frac{r}{100})}.$ Now since $r$ is very small, we can approximate the denominator by using only the first term of the given Taylor series $\ln(1+\frac{r}{100}) \approx \frac{r}{100},$ which gives us $n = \frac{100 \ln 2} {r}.$ We now substitute into the previous equation to get
$$
x = 100 \ln 2 \approx 69.3.
$$
