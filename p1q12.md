##  Warmup Questions

1. A binary number consists of only $1$s and $0$s. How many values can be represented by a $8$-bit binary number?

1. How many different ways are there to arrange 5 people $(A,B,C,D,E)$ in a line if A must be at the either end of it?

1. How many $3$ digit numbers exist, using only even digits? 
*Hint: 3 digit numbers cannot begin with a 0.*


## CSAT Question
Let $n < 10$ be a non-negative integer. How many integers from $0$ to $999$ inclusive have the sum of their digits equal to $n$? Give your answer in terms of $n$. 
*Hint:* Try first for integers from $0$ to $99$.

## Hints
1. How many possible digits are there?

1. Considering there are up to $3$ digits, if $n=9$, what are the largest $3$ numbers that can be made? What does this tell us about the distribution of $n$?

1. Values adding to $n$ are moved between the $3$ digits. What problem is this analogous to?

1. Consider mapping this to a balls in boxes problem. 

1. If there are $n$ balls and $3$ boxes, how many arrangements are there?

1. Treat the boxes as walls that divide them. How many permutations of walls and balls are there?

## Solution
This problem is analogous to a balls in boxes problem. Let there be $3$ boxes (representative of 3 maximum digits) and $n < 10$ balls (each representing a unit of value). For example, the image below displays the arrangement for the number 312 where $n=6$.

If our first box is empty, then we have a two digit number. If our first two boxes are empty, then we have a 1 digit number.


We may further consider the boxes to be represented by 2 inner walls separating the 3 boxes. We now calculate the number of permutations that these 2 walls and $n$ balls can be in. We have in total $n+2$ objects, which can be arranged in $(n+2)!$ ways. However, the $n$ balls and the 2 walls are indistinguishable, so we divide by $n! \cdot 2!$

$$\therefore \frac{(n+2)!}{n! \cdot 2!} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$$
