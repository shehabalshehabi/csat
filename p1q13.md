## Hints
1. How many steps in total must be taken?
2. From a total of $m+n$ steps, how many are rightward steps and how many are downward steps?
3. If we have $m$ rightward steps, how many combinations of them are there?
4. For each combination of rightward steps, how many combinations of downward steps are there?

## Solution

Regardless of the path taken, you must travel $m$ steps right and $n$ steps down. Of these consecutive $m+n$ steps, we consider the number of different ways we may choose $m$ to be rightward steps. This is $\binom{m+n}{m}$. For each of these combinations, the remaining $n$ steps down are uniquely determined i.e. there is only 1 combination since $\binom{m+n-m}{n} = \binom{n}{n} = 1$, so $\binom{m+n}{m}$ is our final answer.

Similarly, we may first find the combinations of $n$ downward steps and fix rightward steps to obtain $\binom{m+n}{n}$ as our answer.

Another way to look at this is to consider the permutations of $m+n$ steps, where $m$ rightward steps and $n$ downward steps are both indistinguishable types of steps. We find the number of permutations for $m+n$ things, and remove (by dividing by) the number of permutations specifically for just the rightwards and downward steps. This gives us the answer $\frac{(m+n)!}{m! \cdot n!}$.

Thus, any of the following expressions are equivalent and correct:

$$\binom{m+n}{m} \equiv \binom{m+n}{n} \equiv \frac{(m+n)!}{m! \cdot n!}$$
