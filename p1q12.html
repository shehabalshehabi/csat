<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>This problem is analogous to a balls in boxes problem. Let there be <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> boxes (representative of 3 maximum digits) and <span class="math inline">\(n &lt; 10\)</span> balls (each representing a unit of value). For example, the image below displays the arrangement for the number 312 where <span class="math inline">\(n=6\)</span>. <img src="https://imgur.com/ub9yiti.png" /></p><p> If our first box is empty, then we have a two digit number. If our first two boxes are empty, then we have a 1 digit number.</p>
<p>We may further consider the boxes to be represented by 2 inner walls separating the 3 boxes. We now calculate the number of permutations that these 2 walls and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> balls can be in. We have in total <span class="math inline">\(n+2\)</span> objects, which can be arranged in <span class="math inline">\((n+2)!\)</span> ways. However, the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> balls and the 2 walls are indistinguishable, so we divide by <span class="math inline">\(n! \cdot 2!\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\therefore \frac{(n+2)!}{n! \cdot 2!} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\]</span></p>
