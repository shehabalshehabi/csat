## CSAT Question
Which values of $k$ give a maximum at $x=-1$ for $f(x)=(k+1)x^4-(3k+2)x^2-2kx$?

## Hints
1. What is the value of derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=-1$?
2. What should be true about the value of the second derivative of $f(x)$ for $x=-1$ to be a maximum?


## Solution
First derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is $(4k+4)x^3-(6k+4)x-2k$, and second derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is $(12k+12)x^2-(6k+4)$. 
Notice that the first derivative is always $0$ at $x=-1$ (N.B. does not depend on $k$). Also, for a stationary point to be a maximum, the second derivative must be negative at $x=-1$ which gives us $12k+12 -(6k+4)<0,$ and hence $k<-\frac{4}{3}$.
