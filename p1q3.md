## CSAT Question
Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with $AB=AC$. Let the circle having diameter $AB$ and centre $O$ intersect $BC$ at some point $P$. Find the ratio $\frac{BP}{BC}$.

## Hints
1. What can you say about $AP$?
2. Can you find $\angle APB$?


## Solution
Angle $\angle APB=\pi/2=90^\circ$ because it subscribes an arc length of $\pi$ (diameter), hence $AP$ is the height in the triangle. Being an isosceles triangle, this is also the median, and hence $\frac{BP}{BC}=\frac{1}{2}$.

Alternative way to solve this problem is to consider triangle $OBP$. Since $O$ is the centre of a circle $|OB|=|OP|$ and $OBP$ is isosceles. Moreover it shares the angle at $B$ with triangle $ABC$. Hence, they are similar and $\frac{BP}{BC} = \frac{BO}{BA} = \frac{1}{2}$.
