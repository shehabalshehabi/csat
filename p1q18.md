## Warmup Questions

1. Imagine a vertical pole on the equator. At midday, the sun is directly over the pole so that it does not cast shadow. If the length of the shadow at 1:00pm is 50cm, how tall is the pole?
(You may assume that the Earth is perfectly spherical and the sun moves directly above the eqautor and a day is excactly 24 hours long.)

2. What is the radius of the line of intersection of two hollow spheres of radius 1 centred 1.5 units apart.

## CSAT Question

You travel on Earthâ€™s surface south $n$ miles, then east $n$ miles, then north $n$ miles and find yourself back where you started, without visiting any point **more than twice**. What is the closest you could have been to the south pole when you started? Assume Earth is a sphere with radius
$R > n$.

## Hints
1. Read the question carefully. In what ways is it possible to return to the starting point ignoring the more than twice requirement.
2. Consider longitude and latitude
3. How does each stage of the path you must take affect longitude and latitude?
4. How many times may you go around the world at the same latitude without visiting a point more than twice?
5. Here is the optimal solution if you are allowed to visit any point at most twice. What is the distance of the starting point to the south pole?

## Solution

Here is the optimal solution if you are allowed to visit any point at most twice:

![Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/yMfTR49.png)

You go down $n$ miles towards the South Pole, then you take a round trip of $n$ miles laterally until you get back to where you were, then you travel up $n$ miles towards the North Pole.

$$
Rsin(\theta)= r, 2{\pi}r = n \\
D = n + R\theta \\
D = n + R    sin^{-1}(\frac{n}{2{\pi}R})
