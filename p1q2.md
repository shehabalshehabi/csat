## CSAT Question
Let $f(x)$ mean that the function $f$ is applied to $x$, and $f^n(x)$ mean $f(f(...f(x)))$, that is $f$ is applied to $x$, $n$ times. Let $g(x)=x+1$ and   $h_n(x)=g^n(x)$. What is $h_n^m(0)$?

## Hints
1. What is $g_n(x)$ in terms of $x$ and $n$?
1. By trying values of $m$, give an expression for $g_n^m(x)$.

## Solution
We have $g_n(x)=f^n(x)=x+n$ since $1$ must be added $n$ times.  To compute $g_n^m(0)$ we may first obtain $g_n^m(x)$, and then evaluate it at $x=0$. 
Consider that $g_n^2(x)=g_n(g_n(x))=g_n(x+n)=x+2n$. We can hence inductively see that $g_n^m(x)=x+mn$. 

$$\therefore g_n^m(0)=mn$$
