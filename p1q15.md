## CSAT Question
Does $30$ divide $n^5-n$ for all positive integers $n$?

## Hints
1. How do you split $30$ into a product of prime factors?
3. Can you factorise $n^5 - n$?
4. You should obtain $n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1)$. What can you say about the product of 3 consecutive numbers in terms of divisibility by $2$ and $3$?
5. If you assume that $5$ divides $n^5-n$, how can you prove that 5 divides $(n+1)^5-(n+1)$?

## Solution
First notice that $30=2\cdot3\cdot5$. Since $2$, $3$ and $5$ are all coprime we will prove that each of them divides $n^5-n$ and hence conclude that their product (which is $30$) has to divide $n^5-n$. To further progress we aim to factorise $n^5-n$ as much as we can. Rewrite 
$$n^5-n=n(n^4-1) = n(n^2-1)(n^2+1) = n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1).$$ Notice that we have used here very important identity, which is $n^2-1 = (n-1)(n+1)$. This is known as the difference of two squares. The product $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is of 3 consecutive numbers, which is divisible by $3!$, and hence divisible by $2$ and $3$. Now we have to prove divisibility by $5$. There are several approaches.

#### Approach 1
We can use principle of mathematical induction. We first verify that hypothesis holds for n=1. Now, we consider $(n+1)^5 - (n+1) = n^5 + 5n^4 + 10n^3 + 10n^2 + 4n = n^5-n + 5(n^4+2n^3+2n^2+n).$
First component is divisible by $5$ due to the induction hypothesis second one is clearly a multiple of 5.
#### Approach 2
Write $n = 5a+b$ and notice that $(5a+b)^5 - (5a+b) \pmod 5 = b^5-b \pmod 5$. Hence we can simply verify that statement holds for $n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.
#### Approach 3
Notice that $n^2+1 \pmod 5 =  n^2-4 \pmod 5 = (n-2)(n+2) \pmod5$. Now we can rewrite 
$n^5-n \pmod 5 = n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1) \pmod5  = n(n-1)(n+1)(n-2)(n+2) \pmod 5$
This is a product of 5 consecutive numbers, hence divisible by $5$.
