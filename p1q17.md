## CSAT Question
  Given a sequence of zeros and ones of length $n$, let $L_n$ be the number of sequences that have no adjacent zeros. Give a recursive formula for $L_n$.

## Hints
1. Try to list all the correct sequences for n=1,2,3.
2. Focus on the first element of a sequence. What cases do you need to consider to reduce a problem to a smaller $n$?
2. If there is a 1 in the first position of a sequence, how many ways (in terms of $L$) are there to finish the sequence?
3. There are $L_{n-1}$ ways to finish a sequence that begins with a 1. What about a sequence that starts with a 0?
4. If the sequence begins with 0 what are possible values on the second element and how many ways are there to finish this sequence?
## Solution
One way to find a recursive formula for $L_n$ is to reduce the problem of size $n$ to a problem of smaller size. To do this we will consider all possibilities for the first element of a sequence. It can be either $1$ or $0$.
* If the word begins with a $1$ it can be followed by any word of length $n-1$ with no adjacent 0s. There are $L_{n-1}$ such words.
* If the word begins with a 0 it has to be followed by a $1$ and then any word of length $n-2$ with no adjacent 0s. There are $L_{n-2}$ such words.

These 2 cases are mutually exclusive so the total number of such words is $L_n=L_{n-1}+L_{n-2}$ which is the same as the Fibonacci recurrence. Note that for $n=2$ there are 3 such words, for $n=3$ there are 5 such words etc., so $L_n=F_{n+2}$.
