## CSAT Question
You have a card of 10cm by 10cm. What is the largest volume in cm$^3$ of a box (without a lid) that can be obtained by cutting out a square of side $x$ from each corner and then folding the flaps up?

## Hints
1. What are the dimensions of the box formed?
1. What is the function that defines the volume of the box?
1. How may we find the maximum point of the function from hint 2?

## Solution
Cutting sides of length $x$ and folding up the flaps results in the prism:

The volume is therefore given by $V(x)=x(10-2x)^2$. Differentiate this to find an $x$ that maximises $V(x)$.

$$V'(x)=(10-2x)^2-4x(10-2x)=4(x-5)(3x-5)$$

So $V'(x)=0$ at $x=5$ and $x=\frac{5}{3}$. Classify these points by considering the shape of cubic functions, using sign diagrams or second derivatives to get that $\frac{5}{3}$ is the maximum. Hence our final answer is

$$V\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)=\frac{2000}{27}.$$
