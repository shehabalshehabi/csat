## CSAT Question
Given a grid of $4\times4$ points, how many triangles with their vertices on the grid can be drawn?

## Hints
1. In how many ways may $3$ points be selected?
1. When do $3$ vertices not form a triangle?
1. How many combinations of $3$ collinear points are there?


## Solution
Triangles are formed by choosing any $3$ points that are not collinear. From a total of $\binom{16}{3}$ possible selected points, we exclude the combinations that form the straight lines shown below:

$10$ lines pass through $4$ points, and hence, we subtract $10 \cdot \binom{4}{3}$ combinations. The additional $4$ smaller diagonals pass through $3$ points, so we subtract $4 \cdot 1$ combinations. Our answer is therefore:

$$\binom{16}{3}-10\binom{4}{3}-4 = 516$$
