## CSAT Question
The Taylor expansion of $\ln(1+x)$ is defined as $\ln(1+x)=x-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}-\cdots$. Expand $\ln\!\left(\frac{1-x}{1+x^2}\right)$ up to and including the 4th power of $x$.

## Hints
1. How can you express $\ln\!\left(\frac{1-x}{1+x^2}\right)$ as a difference of two functions similar to $\ln(1+x)$?

## Solution
Although this question involves Taylor expansion, we do not need to know how to formally expand a function into a Taylor series to answer it. We can denote $f(x)=\ln(1+x)$. Now we need to notice that $\ln\!\left(\frac{1-x}{1+x^2}\right) = \ln(1-x)-\ln(1+x^2) =f(-x)-f(x^2).$ Since the Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ is given in the question we can plug in $-x$ and $x^2$ into this formula to obtain corresponding expansions up to $x^4$ and simply add them. 
$$\ln\!\left(\frac{1-x}{1+x^2}\right)=(-x-\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^3}{3}-\frac{x^4}{4}-\ldots)-(x^2-\frac{x^4}{2}+\ldots)=-x-\frac{3x^2}{2}-\frac{x^3}{3}+\frac{x^4}{4}+\ldots$$
