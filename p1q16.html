<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The question asks us to find <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, which when divided by <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> approximates the number of years needed to double the investment. This translates to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{x}{r} = n.\)</span> Let the initial investment amount be <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span>, and the amount left in the bank after <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> years be <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span>. Each year, the amount increases by <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> percent, which gives us the recurrence <span class="math inline">\(a_{n+1} = a_n(1+\frac{r}{100}).\)</span> This is a standard geometric series. Therefore, the closed form solution is <span class="math inline">\(a_n = a_0 (1+\frac{r}{100})^n.\)</span></p>
<p>We wish to find a particular <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(a_n = 2a_0.\)</span> We now substitute this into the closed form solution above to obtain <span class="math inline">\(2 = (1+\frac{r}{100})^n,\)</span> and apply natural log to get <span class="math inline">\(n = \frac{\ln 2}{\ln(1+\frac{r}{100})}.\)</span> Now since <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is very small, we can approximate the denominator by using only the first term of the given Taylor series <span class="math inline">\(\ln(1+\frac{r}{100}) \approx \frac{r}{100},\)</span> which gives us <span class="math inline">\(n = \frac{100 \ln 2} {r}.\)</span> We now substitute into the previous equation to get <span class="math display">\[
x = 100 \ln 2 \approx 69.3.
\]</span></p>
