## CSAT Question
Using only the functions $\max$ and $\min$ and arithmetic operations (no $\text{if}$ clauses), express the amount of possible overlap between two intervals $[a_1,a_2]$ and $[b_1,b_2]$, where $a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2$ are arbitrary real numbers with $a_1<a_2$ and $b_1<b_2$.

## Hints
1. What is the interval of intersection of $[a_1,a_2]$ and $[b_1,b_2]$?
2. Think about intervals on the real number line. Can you sketch $[a_1,a_2]$ and $[b_1,b_2]$?
3.  Can you express the smallest value in this intersection as a function of $a_1$ and $b_1$?  What about the largest value?

## Solution
The following picture shows an example configuration of  $[a_1,a_2]$ (blue), $[b_1,b_2]$(green) and their intersection(red).

For now assume that intervals intersect. We can notice that the smallest value in this intersection is always $max(a_1, b_1)$, and the largest value in this intersection is $min(a_2,b_2)$. Hence, the amount of overlap of these intervals can be expressed as $min(a_2,b_2)-max(a_1, b_1)$. Intervals intersect only if this value is positive, hence the final formula is $max(0,min(a_2,b_2)-max(a_1, b_1)).$
