## Warmup Questions

1. Four random cards are selected from a [pack of 52](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck). What is the probability that the cards read out $\text{1 3 3 7}$ in that order?

1. Three cards are selected, with replacement. What is the probability that at least one of them is of type heart?

1. A coin is flipped 3 times, displaying either heads ($H$) or tails ($T$). What is the probability that you do not get $\text{H H H}$?




## CSAT Question
Player $A$ rolls one die. Player $B$ rolls two dice. If $A$ rolls a number greater or equal to the largest number rolled by $B$, then $A$ wins, otherwise $B$ wins. What is the probability that B wins?

## Hints

1. Let $a$ represent the number rolled by $A$. Can you represent the probability that $B$ wins in terms of this $a$? 

1. $A$ wins if both of $B$'s dice roll smaller than $a$.

1. Consider the scenario from the previous hint. What is the probability that $B$ does not win for a given $a$?

1. How may we map the expression from the previous hint to some arbitrary $a$?



## Solution
Let $a \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$  represent the number rolled by $A$.

We wish to calculate the probability the $B$ wins i.e. at least one of $B$'s dice rolls higher than $a$. This would be $1$ minus the probability that both of $B$'s dice are smaller than or equal to $A$'s.

For a given $a$, there exist $a$ numbers smaller or equal to $a$ that may be rolled. Therefore, the probability of $B$ winning is given by $1-(\frac{a}{6})^2$.

Now, we are required to consider all possible values of $a$. The probability of any value of $a \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ being rolled is $\frac{1}{6}$. So:
$$\sum_{a=1}^{6} \frac{1}{6}(1-(\frac{a}{6})^2) = \frac{125}{216}$$
