## CSAT Question
 A circle of radius $r$ is tangent at two points on the parabola $y=x^2$ such that the angle between the two radii at the tangent points is $2\theta$, where $0<2\theta<\pi$. Find $r$ as a function of $\theta$.
 

## Hints
1. Let $P$ be one of the points where the parabola and the circle touch. What is an angle between the radius of the circle and tangent to the parabola at point $P$?
2. Let $(x,x^2)$ be coordinates of $P$. What is a slope of the tangent line to the parabola at the point $P$?
3. What is the slope of the normal to the parabola at the point $P$?
4. Notice that the radius of the circle lies on the line normal to the parabola at the point $P$. Also, notice that this line intersects y-axis at an angle $\theta$. Again, what is a slope of normal to the parabola at point $P$?
5. You can find the slope of the tangent using derivatives and the slope of the normal by considering the right-angled triangle with sides of length $r$,$x$ and $rcos(\theta)$. What identity holds for slopes of perpendicular lines and how would you use it to solve this problem?

## Solution

Let $O$ be the centre of the circle and $P$ be one of the points where the circle is tangent to the parabola. The main idea in this solution is to investigate the slopes of the line tangent to the parabola at the point $P$ as well as normal to it. Let these be $l$ and $n$, respectively. Before we move forward, we denote the coordinates of the point $P$ by $(x,x^2)$ (remember that we have parabola $y=x^2$). Now, we  find the slopes:
* To find the slope of the line tangent to the parabola at the point $P$, we may use the fact that derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$ and hence conclude that slope of the line $l$ is $2x$.
* First we notice that since the circle is tangent to the parabola at point $P$ it is also tangent to line $l$ at the same point. Hence, the radius of the circle is perpendicular to line $l$ and lies on the line $n$. 
* To find the slope of the line normal to the parabola (and line $l$ as well) at the point $P$, we denote by $Q$ point on y-axis such that line $PQ$ is parallel to the x-axis. Now we need to investigate triangle $OPQ$. Its hypotenuse has length $r$ and its opposite side is $x$. Since one of its angles is $\theta$ we conclude that the adjacent side is $rcos(\theta)$. Now by definition of slope of line $n$, we find it to be $-\frac{x}{rcos(\theta)}$.

The only thing that is left is to notice that if two lines are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is $-1$. Hence,
$$ \frac{-rcos(\theta)}{x} \cdot 2x = -1 \implies r = \frac{1}{2cos(\theta)}$$
