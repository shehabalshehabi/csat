## Warmup Questions
1. Every day, a builder has to lay 2 more bricks than the total amount of bricks laid in the last 2 days. Express the number of bricks laid a day as a recursive formula.
1. Simplify $\sum_{k=2}^n (\frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k-1})$.

## CSAT Question

  An organism is born on day $k=1$ with $1$ cells. During day $k=2,3,\ldots$ the organism produces $\frac{k^2}{k-1}$ times more new cells than it produced on day $k-1$. Give a simplified expression for the total of all its cells after $n$ days. **Hint:** This is different to the number of new cells produced during day $n$

## Hints
1. Could you formulate the number of new cells each day as a recurrence?
1. Can you write your recurrence relationship in closed form (non-recursive)?
1. The total number of cells on any day is the sum of the number of cells produced by the organism up to that day.
1. Try to rearrange $k\cdot k!$ into a difference between 2 factorials.

## Solution

Denote with $f(k)$ the number of cells grown at step $k$. We have the recurrence

$$f(k)=\frac{k^2}{k-1}\,f(k-1),$$

which we can expand as

$$
=\frac{k^2}{k-1}\cdot\frac{(k-1)^2}{k-2}\,f(k-2) \\
=\frac{k^2}{k-1}\cdot\frac{(k-1)^2}{k-2}\cdot\frac{(k-2)^2}{k-3}\,f(k-3) \\
= k^2 \cdot (k-1) \cdot (k-2) \cdots 1\\
=k \cdot k!.
$$




The total number of cells is thus
$$\sum_{k=1}^n k\cdot k!= \sum_{k=1}^n ((k+1)-1)k! = \sum_{k=1}^n (k+1)! - \sum_{k=1}^n k!,$$ where all the terms except the largest and smallest cancel each other leaving $(n+1)!-1$.
